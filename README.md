# C-Practice
Repository for learning and practicing C.

=C/Terminal==
To compile C programs, type:

gcc -ansi -wall -pedantic -o [path/output-name] [path/source-file-name]

When formatting in printf() e.g %6.1f, it means right justify text atleast
6 digits with 1 decimal place. The total width of the space is 6.

To delete words in terminal, ctrl-W repeatedly if needed.

=GIT==
Useful git commands
"git add -A" is the same as "git add ."
(. means everything in your directory and -A means all)

=OTHER TIPS==
In terminal, you can show hidden files to access the .vimrc file to customize
vim. The command is:
	"defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles [YES/NO]"

files ending in .swp are state files; also .swp files are created by Vim, they should be automatically deleted when you close the file and exit the editor.
