# C-Practice
Repository for learning and practicing C.

To compile C programs, type:

gcc -ansi -wall -pedantic -o [path/output-name] [path/source-file-name]

=GIT==
Useful git commands
"git add -A" is the same as "git add ."
(. means everything in your directory and -A means all)

=OTHER TIPS==
In terminal, you can show hidden files to access the .vimrc file to customize
vim. The command is:
	"defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles [YES/NO]"

files ending in .swp are state files; also .swp files are created by Vim, they should be automatically deleted when you close the file and exit the editor.
